    "```\n",

    "Now is also a good time to look at the documentation (after having solved the issue, as documentation is supposed to be used). Even though not using bash, I can't think of another place to see the docs except `man bash`. These following escape sequences look relevant:\n",

    "      be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems to work without it, but let's be nice.\n",

    "```\n",
